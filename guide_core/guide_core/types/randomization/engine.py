"""The single sampling authority.

``Randomizer`` is the one chokepoint for randomness in the framework. Every
draw goes through :meth:`Randomizer.draw`, which does exactly one of two things
— sample from the passed generator, or (when an injection record supplies the
name) decode the previously realized value — and **always** records the result.
Geometry never samples; tasks never call ``random``/``np.random`` directly.
